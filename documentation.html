            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Chocolate is one of the most popular candies in the world. Each year, residents of the United States collectively eat more than 2.8 billion pounds. 
            However, not all chocolate bars are created equal! This dataset contains expert ratings of over 1,700 individual chocolate bars, along with information on their regional origin, 
            percentage of cocoa, the variety of chocolate bean used, and where the beans were grown.</p>

            <p>As seen below, the previous idea for the Flavors of Cacao data visualization took the form of a pie chart, but I quickly realized that the amount of data I wanted to present was too large for the wedges provided, and would not be easily viewed by the targeted audience. After spending some more time researching, a bar graph was deemed the more appropriate choice.</p>

            <p>Shades of brown were chosen to be utilized in the final visualizations for a homogeneous effect for the viewer, and to nod to the content of the data in the visualizations itself, that being chocolate. 
            A bar graph was found to be more suitable for the data being presented, with that data being pulled from Excel and implemented into the bar graph to display the most popular chcolate bar companies in terms of amount of chocolate bar variety. 
            The YouTube video, linked above, will walk you through the interactive data visualization for the Flavors of Cacao dataset, showing the viewer how the data was take from Excel and implemented into the interactive data visualization. </p>
